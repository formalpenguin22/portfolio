## Welcome

My name is Oliver Hansen and I am a Senior Computer engineering student at George Fox University. I love to work with computers and have a passion for learning new things. I’ve grown up in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and I love to get outdoors to go hiking or surfing. 

Since starting my education I have recreated the classic breakout game from scratch in C, developed and implemented a functional near-infrared spectroscopy brain scanner, and most recently started working as a project manager for a design project with a-dec dental equipment. 

I am looking to connect with companies are seeking help developing and maintaining embedded systems, write firmware in C/C++, or testing and verification of existing products.
