# Hello There!
Dearest Professor(s), you may be wondering... "Where are the projects?" well they will exist soon, but I spent wayyyy too much time building this website. I think this was a valueable use of my time though, because now any employer that wants to know more about me can just peruse this site instead of reading my linkedin! Oh, but this site also links to my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ohansen22)/[resume](/assets/documents/oliver_hansen_resume.pdf)/[github](https://github.com/formalpenguin22)
